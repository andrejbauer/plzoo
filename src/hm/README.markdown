An eager impure functional language with an hindley-milner type system that supports
type inference, parametric polymorphism and value restriction. 
The implementation contains a parser, type inference,
and an interpreter. The language has integers, references, first class
functions, and a general fixpoint operator.

The file `example.hm` demonstrates the usage of the value restriction.

The implementation is based on the article [Efficient and Insightful Generalization](http://okmij.org/ftp/ML/generalization.html) by Oleg Kiselyov.
