Miniprolog is a minimalist prolog interpeter. It does not contain cuts, arithmetic, lists,
or equality -- just basic Horn clauses.

The terms of the language consist of:

* constants, which are strings of alphanumeric characters, starting
  with a lower case letter.
* variables, which are strings of alphanumeric characters, starting
  with a upper case letter.
* composite terms of the form `f(t1, ..., tn)` where `f` is a constant
  and `t1`, …, `tn` are terms.

Examples of terms are: `x`, `y`, `X`, `A`, `son(abel, adam)`, `less(X, plus(X, one))`.

You may type in assertions and queries. An atomic assertion is written
as a term followed by a period,

    assertion.

an inference rule (complex assertion) is written as

    goal :- subgoal1, ..., subgoalN.

where `assertion`, `goal`, `subgoal1`, …, `subgoalN` are terms. A query is written as
(including the "`?-`")

    ?- query.

where query is a term. You may type assertions and queries at the
command line or place them in a file. See the enclosed examples.
