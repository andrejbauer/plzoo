An implementation of the untyped λ-calculus.

The λ-calculus is an equational theory and so does not by itself enforce a notion of
computation. There are several strategies for normalizing redices, which in `lambda` can
be controlled with directives:

* `:eager` - reduce arguments of applications
* `:lazy` - do not reduce arguments of applications
* `:deep` - reduce inside abstractions
* `:shallow` - do not reduce inside abstractions

We can combine these to get various reduction strategies:

|            |    `:eager`      |        `:lazy`        |
|-----------:|:----------------:|:---------------------:|
| `:shallow` | weak normal form | weak head normal form |
| `:deep`    | normal form      | head normal form      |

In terms of programming language terminology, weak normal form corresponds approximately
to call by value and the weak head normal form to call by name.

##### Example interaction

The file `example.lambda` contains an example session which defines booleans, numbers, and
lists. You can use it as follows:

    $ ./lambda.native -l example.lambda
